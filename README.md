# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This was the fourth project on the Technigo boot camp. The assignment was to create a piece of the boardgame Cluedo, using arrays and objects and connecting them to the DOM.

## The problem

A lot of the design was already done, so I could start with the logic right away. I finished the blue requirements first in one go. I then started adding my own styling which, as always, took a long time and effort. Making the styling decisions is by far the most difficult thing for me and effects the whole process. But after adding a cool dripping effect to my header I moved on and finished the red level. After that I went astray again and added nice but unnecessary features and functions, like different display windows, and a function that capitalizes the first letter in a word or sentence. I also ,ade some of the functions universal. I'm not sure if that made the code cleaner or just more confusing. I managed to finish the black level as well before trying out adding event listeners and making the site a bit more responsive.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the project. If I would have had more time I would have liked to try out a scrolling function for mobiles and played around more with the styling.
